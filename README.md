A Password Complexity Checker is a security tool designed to evaluate the strength of a password based on specific criteria. The primary goal is to ensure that the password is robust enough to resist common attack methods such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and social engineering.

Key Features:
Length Analysis: Checks if the password meets the minimum length requirement, typically 8-12 characters or more. Longer passwords are generally more secure.

Character Variety: Ensures that the password includes a mix of character types such as:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Numbers (0-9)
Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)
Common Patterns Detection: Identifies and flags passwords that follow predictable patterns, such as "password123" or "qwerty," which are easily guessable.

Dictionary Lookup: Cross-references the password against a database of commonly used passwords to ensure itâ€™s not on a list of frequently compromised passwords.

Feedback Mechanism: Provides real-time feedback to the user, indicating the strength of the password and offering suggestions for improvement if it does not meet the necessary criteria.

Benefits:
Improved Security: By encouraging the creation of stronger passwords, the tool significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
User Awareness: Educates users about best practices for password creation, making them more vigilant about their security choices.
Compliance: Helps organizations meet security standards and regulations that require strong password policies.
This checker is a vital component in a broader security strategy, serving as the first line of defense against potential cyber threats.
